    <h2>How To Use Conveyor</h2>
    <p>Conveyor is a task list app like many others but with most of the complex options, toggles, and settings removed so you can focus on creating and completing tasks.</p>
    <h3 id="First_Point_Header">Adding a Task</h3>
    <p>Tap the "add new task" text entry field, which hangs out towards the bottom of the screen. The keyboard appears as if by magic, and the task entry field floats to the center of the screen so you can see what the heck you're typing!</p>
    <p>You have a few different ways to save the task:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hit "Done" on the keyboard. This will save the task on the list you are currently viewing (Today, Tomorrow, or Later).</li>
      <li>A little twist on the above: if you end your task with the words "today", "tomorrow", or "later" it will be saved in that list when you hit "Done" (and that word will be stripped from the task when saved).</li>
      <li>Above the keyboard as you type the task is a row of buttons, labelled "today", "tomorrow", and "later". You can tap one of those buttons to save the task on that list.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro User Feature #1</strong>: To make a repeating task, include "@rpt" in your task text somewhere. It will not show up on the task list but will make your task a repeating one. Repeating tasks have an icon indicating that they repeat, and they automatically reschedule themselves for "tomorrow" when completed.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro User Feature #2</strong>: To make a priority task, include "@!" in your task text somewhere. It will not show up on the task list but will float the task to the top of the list. Priority tasks have an icon indicating that they are high priority, and being at the top of the "today" task list also means that task will show up on certain Watch complications.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="First_Point_One_Header">High Priority &amp; Repeating Tasks</h3>
    <p><strong>Pro users only!</strong></p>
    <p>Creating tasks with special status makes use of "@" tags in the task text itself.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simply add "@!" to a task when creating or editing it to make it high priority. High priority tasks get a nifty little icon showing how important they are, and float to the top of the list they are on.</li>
      <li>Add "@rpt" to a task when creating or editing it to make it repeating. Repeating tasks automatically rescheduled themselves for "tomorrow" when completed (and of course also get a nifty little icon indicating that they will repeat).</li>
      <li>To change the status of a priority or repeating task, simply tap to edit the task and remove the "@" tag.</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="right"><a href="#toc_top">top</a></p>
    <h3 id="Second_Point_Header">Task Migration</h3>
    <p>Each day at or around midnight (it's not entirely up to the app, iOS plays by its own set of rules sometimes), your entire list of tasks in each list will reschedule themselves.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tasks in the "Later" list move to the "Tomorrow" list.</li>
      <li>"Tomorrow" tasks move to the "Today" list.</li>
      <li>Any tasks on the "Today" list that were not completed are marked as "Overdue". This just means they turn red.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the reschedule doesn't happen automatically, it will happen immediately the first time you open the app each day.</p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#toc_top">top</a></p>
    <h3 id="Third_Point_Header">Task Swipe Actions</h3>
    <p>You can swipe left and right on a task to perform a set of actions.</p>
    <p>Swipe right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete the task</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it! Swiping right reveals a button to complete the action, and a LONG swipe right without lifting you finger will complete the action without having to tap on the button. Magic!</p>
    <p>Swipe left to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete the task (trash can icon)</li>
      <li>Reschedule the action (which basically just means move it to another list)</li>
      <li>Lock the action (this is only available on the "Later" list)</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="right"><a href="#toc_top">top</a></p>
    <h3 id="Fourth_Point_Header">Locking Tasks</h3>
    <p>Locking tasks deserves a little explanation.</p>
    <p>When a task is on the "Later" list, you can lock it in place so that it doesn't get rescheduled automatically nightly. You can choose to lock it forever so it remains in place until you unlock it, or choose to lock it for a specific number of days.</p>
    <p>Locking it temporarily will mark the task with a numbered icon showing you how many days are left until it automatically unlocks, and this number gets smaller every day.</p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#toc_top">top</a></p>
    <h3 id="Fifth_Point_Header">Settings</h3>
    <p>Conveyor has a settings screen with a few options for you to play with.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Badge Options</strong>: If you have allowed notifications, the app has a badge number showing the total items in the "Today" list that remain to be done. You can configure this in settings to only show Overdue items, or to just remove the badge altogether.</li>
      <li><strong>Lock Options</strong>: You can choose the default behavior for locking tasks in the "Later" list so that you aren't asked what to do every time.</li>
      <li><strong>Task Completion Options</strong>: Choose the default behavior when you complete a task (either keep it with a strikethrough or delete it immediately). If you choose to keep the task with a strikethrough it will automatically be deleted each night.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Email</strong>: There is a link that opens a blank email addressed to our support address.</li>
      <li><strong>Review on App Store</strong>: Don't be shy!</li>
      <li><strong>Help</strong>: What you're reading right now.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlock Pro Features</strong>: The list of in-app purchases. Unlock the set of Pro features, or just send us a much-appreciated tip to help keep the lights on and keep us developing cool new features!</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="right"><a href="#toc_top">top</a></p>
    <h3 id="Sixth_Point_Header">Watch App</h3>
    <p>The Watch app lets you view today's tasks, check off completed tasks, reschedule tasks, and add tasks to any list using the standard Watch user input interface. It also features complications for every watch face that show at a glance how many tasks you have due today, as well as the next 1-3 items due (depending on the watch face and complication selected).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Task List</strong></li>: From the main task list on the Watch app you can tap the circle to complete a task. You can also the task title to open up the detail screen where you can view the full title text, complete the task, or reschedule it to a different list (Tomorrow or Later).
      <li><strong>Adding a task</strong>: When adding a task you are presented with the standard Watch user input selections: dictation, scribble, or emoji. If you include the words "tomorrow" or "later" in your task it will be added to that list on your iOS device, otherwise it will be added to the "Today" list by default and show up in your watch app as well.</li>
    </ul>
