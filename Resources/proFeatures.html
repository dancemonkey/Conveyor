    <h2>Why Go Pro?</h2>
    <p>Besides supporting the continued development of Conveyor and enabling the team to continue to add new features to the app, you get a couple of new features now that are only available to Pro users.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Repeating tasks</strong>: Include the tag "@rpt" in your task text to mark it as repeating. Repeating tasks have a small indicator icon to show that they repeat. Now whenever you complete the task it will re-schedule itself for tomorrow.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize tasks</strong>: Include the tag "@!" to mark a task as high-priority. High-priority tasks have a small indicator icon to show their high priority status, and also float to the top of the list.</li>
      <li><strong>Colors</strong>: You can tag your tasks with pre-defined colors in order to emphasize them, use colors as categories, or just make things look prettier. Use an "@" tag followed by the color: for instance "@blue" will tag a task blue on the device and fill in the checkbox with blue on the Today widget and Watch app extensions. A list of all colors supported is on the Help screen.</li>
      <li>More! We will continue to develop and add new features for both free and pro users.</li>
    </ul>
