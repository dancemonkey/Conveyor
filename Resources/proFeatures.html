    <h2>Why Go Pro?</h2>
    <p>Besides supporting the continued development of Conveyor and enabling the team to continue to add new features to the app, you get a number of new features only available to Pro users.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeating tasks: Include the tag "@rpt" in your task text to mark it as repeating. Repeating tasks have a small indicator icon to show that they repeat. Now whenever you complete the task it will re-schedule itself for tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Prioritize tasks: Include the tag "@!" to mark a task as high-priority. High-priority tasks have a small indicator icon to show their high priority status, and also float to the top of the list.</li>
      <li>More! We will continue to develop and add new features for both free and pro users.</li>
    </ul>
